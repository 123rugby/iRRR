# iRRR

The folder contains main MATLAB functions for implementing the integrative reduced rank regression method. The method provides a flexible tool box for multivariate regression analysis with multi-view predictors. 

Main files:

iRRR_binary3.m		a function for multivariate regression with binary responses and multi-view predictors

iRRR_normal3.m		a function for multivariate regression with continuous responses and multi-view predictors

Sim_Normal_Setting.m	a file with different simulation settings under the Gaussian assumption (i.e., Settings 1-5 in the main paper) 

Sim_Normal_Run.m	a file that implements iRRR under the settings from Sim_Normal_Setting.m (the results replicate those of iRRR in the main paper)

Sim_Binary_Setting.m	a file with different simulation settings under the bianry assumption (i.e., Settings 6-7 in the main paper) 

Sim_Binary_Run.m	a file that implements iRRR under the settings from Sim_Binary_Setting.m (the results replicate those of iRRR in the main paper)
